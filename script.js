/* Your tasks:

OOP CHALLENGES!!!!!------------------------

Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a
'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in
km/h

Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,
and log the new speed to the console

Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log
the new speed to the console

Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and
'brake' multiple times on each of them
Test data:
Â§ Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
Â§ Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€ */

/* const Car = function (make, speed) {

  this.speed = speed;

/*
Coding Challenge #2
Your tasks:

Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')

Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide
by 1.6)

Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but
converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)

Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
methods, and with the getter and setter.
Test data:
Â§ Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
